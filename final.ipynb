    "Класс А1 - самый начальный не представлен в дф, очевидно что с таким уровнем знания языка - рано учить английский по фильмам, нужно подтянуть теорию. С2 - профессиональное владение, насколько я изучил информацию до сих пор идет спор среди ученых - может ли не носитель языка освоить не родной язык на таком уровне. В любом случае на этом уровне уже не требуется учить язык. Уровней + нет в словаре, там где несколько уровней оставим тот - который сложнее. Если пользователь посмотрит несколько фильмов и ничего не поймет - мотивация изучать язык таким образом скорее всего станет ниже чем, если после просмотра фильм покажется чуть проще чем хотелось бы.

    "В ходе выполнения задачи, самую большую сложность представляет этап предобработки субтитров в список существующих слов, без всех посторонних символов. Думаю что это актуально для любой nlp и очевидно что признак в виде очищенного текста - получается очень 'громозким'. Сложные модели (бустинги) скорее всего показали бы более высокую точность, но считают они очень долго, необходимы ресурсы другого уровня, точно не локальные. Так же возможно использовать нейронки, но углубляться в эту тему самостоятельно за небольшое время - не лучшее решение. \n",
